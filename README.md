## My process

~ I started building this site by using CSS GRID, FLEXBOX and SEMANTIC HTML MARKUP and BOOTSTRAP. Firstly, i build a big screen resolution design later i converted into responsive, which is suitable for every screen resolution.

You can see many css properties i used in the code. I Build the page by dividing it into parts, started with creating nav bar, later it has article, section and footer semantics.

Later i add some effects like HOVER and somme transitions. 

Every button in page will works and i added some effects using JS
